It’s really big and great. When I first stepped into the west wing that our competition will be held, a strong feeling of achievement and happiness came to my heart suddenly. You’ll never know how excited I was at that time. As soon as we had finished the preparation, the team across from us came and talk with us, they are really friendly and fantastic. I don’t know why I was very pleasured to speak with them in English although my English is not very well. They are interested in China, they said that the most impressive thing for them of China is the High Speed Train. They even call it bullet train. Then we talked a lot about the differences between China and America.","link":"/2019/04/26/A-perfect-event/"},{"title":"Coming back","text":"How is life?

Special dateThe mid-term examination will begin tomorrow. It must be the longest and richest exam I had ever participated. A little nervous with excitement. I don’t know what will be asked tomorrow, but I really enjoy the exam by English. So, why I am writing now instead of reviewing? I planed to review the geography and history during the late-self study. To my surprise, I finish my goal earlier and even review the chemistry and physics. Country Road Take Me HomeI could say that it’s the best song and lifelong song to me. It involves too much motions and affection for me. I still remember listening this song in the whole time of staying on the Boeing 787 belonged to Hainan Airline. That’s a trip has had left a deep mark in my heart and also has changed the rest of my life. LuckyComing to the international course, there are many unbelievable and surprising things happened. I met CRX many times by accident. I got back to working on VEX Robotics Competition and gain the qualification to go to the World Championships. (one week later!!!) I finally stand on the same side with my best friends Billy. All the classmates and teachers are friendly and benignant. Many times when I was doing the math questions, I find the shadow of computer science. I am going to participate an math competition named ARML. It’s my first time to do math by groups. I am really keen on working with groups and enjoying the different thinking collison. I met a person that I even forget his name and where I met by accidently. He is from the international course in middle school who is the merely person that I have recognized in that course. There are so many things I want to talk about… Keeping on!After writing the diary, I really feel more delighted.

In addition, it’s time for me to do some review. One of the colorful activitiesMay is the month of all kinds of colorful activities in my school. I participated in the bridge building competition which I was really reluctant to at first. Hard and harsh It was really a hard and harsh time for me to build a beautiful and strong bridge because I had no idea about any stuff about the bridge. What’s more, I have a team that I didn’t appreciate previously. Maybe I just wanted to do it with the mentality of playing.What kind of bridge, how to build the pillar, how to connect all the parts united? I didn’t know how to deal with these massive problems. We just went forward step by step, mistake by mistake.My teammate, Skywing (a frightening name right?), who is talented in building arches for the bridge, tried to make tons of archs used for his bow and arrow instead of being a part of our bridge. I didnot know how to persuade him at all. But luckily, he finally finshed the arch customed only for our bridge. PresentationMaybe it’s a pretty sucessful presentation? I don’t know. However, it’s my first time to stand in the face of all the students from fundation class. I weared a suit because I think it’s a very formal occasion to show my respect. I was told I only had 5 minutes to present which truly makes me nervous and anxious. At the moment standing on the stage, I saw the expecting eyes from the audience clearly. Speaking aloud with the gesture of my hand, it’s the only thing I remember. Everything including additional preparation was all forgotten behind my head. When I finished, I heard applause one after another. I was excited and proud of my teammates and myself. ResultWe won the Design Award and Aesthetic Award finally. It really surprised my teammates and me. Something I learn from itTeam spiritWe are like a loose sand at first but after the hone, we all have grown up in several aspects. I am very thankful to my teammates Skywing, Wooken and Sydeny.

My classmate Vivian who is good at English and speaks fluently invited me to participate in a debate competition because of vacancy of her partner. Thinking that the students who are good at oral English are all in the debate club, I accept the invitation at once. Think now, I am thankful for Vivian to give me a chance to face new challenge. We should finish our debate draft early but it lasted until three days before the official competition. Just coming back from the VEX worlds, I was excited and felt still live in the life there. Exactly, the debate competition came. Vivian and I prepared for the debate on the whole Monday night. Both of us are students living, but we used phones and computer secretly just like thief, preventing from discovering by the teacher. My assignment was the draft of PROS. The debate topic was about refugees. I strangled my brain to write down everything I could think about. It was hard but expanded my thinking a lot. A normal nightThe last night before the debate competition. I got the suit and tried on in my dormitory. My dormmate helped me to adjust the tie. There exist a second, I felt very lucky to be classmates and friends with them. I intended to review the debate draft at night, but I fell asleep quickly and unconsciously. 5:50 AM, the teacher woke me up. I got up quickly without any sleepy. To my surprise, my dormmate encouraged me and hoped me to get a good rank, even he was sleeping on the bed well. Exciting dayWe had 4 rounds on the first day. Every time we were PROS unexpectedly. I really enjoyed the feeling and atmosphere when two sides were debating. Just like a spark collision of thinking. We even beat the Nanjing Foreign Language School because of the excellent cooperation of Vivian and me. On the afternoon, when all the rounds ended. I heard my name from the host. We entered the top eight! On the busBecause we were PROS in all four rounds, I thought we were familiar with the strategy and pace of PROS. Then, I suggested Vivian being PROS tomorrow if it was possible. But it was the divergence of us. She had finished the CONS draft but it didn’t work at all. She want to be the CONS tomorrow. I requested her on the whole way back to the school. Finally, I gave up. I realized that I was a little impolite to treat a girl in this way. Everybody need to practice and exercise in the competition. I apologized to her and then prepare for the next day. Unexpected resultsWe are the last of the quarter-finals, which means that the first day of our first knockout opponent is the first place. We were hopeless but tried our best to compete for the top four. After the competition, we felt that we were certainly lose the game. But to our surprise, we won the game!!! Both of Vivian and I was too excited because we defeated the group first. At that moment, I felt like my heart is jumping out! But we lost the semifinal at last. However, we were still very happy because it’s a very perfect ranking. Think more deeplyFirst, I have made many friends through the competition. They are from Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, which are more advanced than Xi’an. There are many things I can consult and learn form them. Also, I find all the competition whatever the field is, robot, computer, debate, the true meaning is meet more friends and expand my horizons. Second, I understand and cherish my old friends more. After a competition, a few days staying together, we all made progress and became a better me. The old friends, the partners, they are different for me. We learned from each other and communicate more effectively. At lastAt last, I want to say that thanks to Vivian, I learned a lot from her. Not only about the skills of debating, but also the truth of life.","link":"/2019/05/12/My-first-debate-competition/"},{"title":"NOW sees the FUTURE by the PAST","text":"while, time flies.

Just a few minutes ago, I was sleeping deeply, but now I think I am conscious. Sleepless night From the beginning of the summer vacation, I was studying TOEFL everyday following a regular routine – getting up at 7AM, doing TOEFL practice all the day and then going to bed at 11PM. However, Last night even didn’t close my eyes for a while because of the unfinished autonomous program. It’s a hard and harsh work putting tons of parameters and variables to my mind simultaneously. Fortunately, with my team members Tony and Jessica helping me reset the match field quickly and accurately, finally I got it. Never forget the colorful cubes leaps on the match field which seem to lose control. Nervous time To be honest, I didn’t put too many efforts in the VEX competition these summer vacation. I just came to participate in training two days before our setting off. I am really awkward to my excellent team member and coach Mr. Han. The robot that will be used in the competition hadn’t been finished two days before. Our manipulator Tony hadn’t practice controlling the robot like catching the cube and pile them up in the specific area which is not easy and definitely needs time to be familiar with the way of controlling. Luckily, we had done everything in time under the unity of our team which is the most valuable and precious thing I got from the robot club. I saw everyone mounting screw carefully, writing engineer log amazingly… There exists many good personalities and characters that I need to learn from them. Maybe I don’t have time to write again during the competition I know that from now on every day and night is crucial and significant. Many unpredictable challenges and chances are waiting for us in the close future. What I can do is modifying and improving the stability and effectiveness of my program giving the mental encouragement. Perhaps every night will become sleepless just like last night, but I will try my best to fight for the best ranking in the competition. Also, I would like to make more friends from all over the world with the same passion and love for the VEX.

I never imagined that I would met a group of people who are talented and friendly in my freshman. When I first came here, I was very enlightend but of course with a little nervous. However, the enthusiasm of students and teachers made me energetic and full of hope towards the future. Super massive activitiesThere were many meaningful and unforgettable events and activities have been held this semester. Not only broadening my horizon but also building a bridge between the guys who have the same dream and interest with me. I firstly picked up VEX Robotics competition which I had learned and fell in love with before. The same program but different people. I met Jessica, a very talented girl in our team, who is good at writing building log and the most important I think is that she treats everthing careful and make 100% efforts in. She is an example for me and there are many things I can learn from her. What’s more, I participated in NSDA debate. To be honest, it was my first time to express my own views about a social problem detaily in the face of others, even in English. It was a big challenge but I also learned a lot from it. I will never forget the moment that we beat the opponents ranking the first place temporarily. Also, taking part in many Discipline Competition such as Math, Chemistry. For instance, In the preparation of the ARML, I came into contact with the Team Match which is brand new for me. I really enjoyed the process that thinking and dicussing with others together including relay rounds. graduation ceremony The last event that I had in my freshman is the graduation ceremony. ( I mean graduated from senior I to senior II) There was a video edited by my classmates reviewing the whole years about our class. Although I came here later instead at the very beginning, I was moved by it. I am glad and pleasured to be a member of Foundation III. Maybe we will not be appered as a unity once more, but we were once a unity. It’s enough for us to keep in touch with each other and perish the friendship forever. A unpredictable vacation starts nowI need a plan about my valuable vacationThere is no doubt that I will have my first TOEFL test this vacation, and also I need to work hard to reach the highest score as possible as I can. I want to put my general plan here because I hope there are someone who can take it and supervise me. Also, because I put it on my own blog, I would be more careful and serious about these tasks and do not be lazy frequently. [ ] Every day at least 3 pieces of TOEFL Reading passages [ ] Every day at least 3 pieces of TOEFL Listening materials Every day using app “Lingo Champ” to practice my spoken English Every week writing at least 1 pieces of blog. Every week doing exercices at least 3 times. Everyday do some reading at leat 20 min. To be continued… I hope to get your supervision. If you see these, please leave a message below. Your words will definately encourage and urge me to move forword!

From my childhood, I have watched plenty of films including comedy, science friction, actin, plot… but none of them could make me cry. I even usually laugh at my mother crying while watching some TV series and reality show. However, now , it’s time for me to change my mind. I would like to introduce this film to you, a fantastic one that makes cold me cry. IntroductionThe film I want talk about is called Rudy, which is a famous biographical sports film directed by David Anspaugh. The film is an account of life of Daniel “Rudy” Ruettiger who has been fighting for his football dream by all efforts despite significant obstacle. Watching by chanceI’m not myself today because of something that even I didn’t know. I simply searched on Youtube to find some introductions and recommendations about some inspirational films. Fortunately, the first text come into view is of course this film Rudy. Therefore, I downloaded it at once watching it. Something really touch meI am not going to spoil anything, just a few plots that really impressed me. On his best friend’s funeralHe was despair and depress when the song begun. Rushing out of the church to cry and cry, to my surprise, he decided to go to Notre Dame University which he appreciated since his birth but nobody believed him could have done that. With no hesitate, no excess grief, he take the bus directly in the cold night. Standing on the changing room reading the text graved on the wallAfter he was allowed to take a job in charge of logistics of football team, he went to work. Once he got there, he looked at the text graved on the wall like a Saint reading the text devoutly. I can see the passion and dream from his words and eyes. Everyone in the gym cheering for RudyAfter the friend in Rudy’s team first called his name, the voice spreading across the whole gym with everyone no matter if recognized Rudy beginning to cheer for Rudy including his old friends, teammates, family… My personal feelingI believed that a good film doesn’t require something spectacular or amazing, just a normal one with an unusual dream like the film. From some extent, Rudy is me, I am Rudy. I see myself on him. I cheer for myself, for my dream. At last, some inspiring line for myself: Having dreams is what makes life tolerable In this life you don’t have to prove nothing to nobody except yourself. And after what you’ve done through, if you haven’t done by now, it ain’t gonna never happen. And I guarantee a week won’t go by, you won’t regret walking out letting them get the best of you. My whole life, people have been telling me what I could do and couldn’t do. I’ve always listened to them, believed in what they said. I don’t want to do that anymore.","link":"/2019/08/17/new-way-to-record-my-life/"},{"title":"动态规划1","text":"笔记最优子结构：子结构最优，全局一定最优无后效性：各个决策部分单独存在，不会相互影响 确定状态 维度从低往高试 确定转移方程 每一个状态的决策 初始值 边界问题 是否可以降低维度或其他优化 最大子串和 题意：给你一个有正有负的序列，求一个=子串（连续的一段），使其和最大！样例输入： -5 6 -1 5 4 -7样例输出： 14 状态：f[i]表示前i个数的最大子串和，每个状态只有两种决策：1. 与前面构成一个子串 2. 单独成为一个子串的开头转移方程: $f[i]=max(f[i-1]+a[i],a[i])$ 不相交的两个子串的最大和 给你一个有正有负的序列，求两个不重叠的子串，使其和最大！ 方法一两个不重叠的子串中间一定有一个分界点，我们可以枚举这个分界点，分别求出这个点左边的最大子串和以及右边的最大子串和 方法二定义状态f[i][j]为前i个数组成了j个子串的最大值，当前状态下有两种选择，一种是与前面组成子串，一种是单独成为一个子串，但是需要枚举这个数前面的串的结尾在哪里状态转移方程为$f[i][j]=max(f[i-1][j]+a[i],f[k][j-1]+a[i],0&lt;k&lt;i​$优化：可以用前缀和维护k维度，算出前k个数的最大和 最大子矩形 在一个矩阵中找到一个子矩阵，该子矩阵和最大！！输出最大和即可。 从暴力的角度考虑，这道题需要枚举矩形的两个顶点，也就是O(n^4)我们可以只枚举两个顶点的行坐标，即找到这个矩形的高度所在的位置，然后把每一列的数之和求出来当做一个数，可以提前求出每一列前缀和，也就转化成了求最大子串和。 最长公共子序列 给定两个序列X和Y，当另一序列Z既是X的子序列又是Y的子序列时，称Z是序列X和Y的公共子序列。最长公共子序列:公共子序列中长度最长的子序列。给定两个序列X={x1,x2,…,xm}和Y={y1,y2,…, yn}，找出X和Y的一个最长公共子序列。 状态：f[i][j]表示X的前i位与Y的前j位最长公共子序列的长度转移方程： for(int i=1;i&lt;=m;i++)for(int j=1;j&lt;=n;j++){ if(X[i]==Y[j]) f[i][j]=f[i-1][j-1]+1; else f[i][j]=max(f[i-1][j],f[i][j-1]);} 回文词 回文词是一种对称的字符串——也就是说，一个回文词，从左到右读和从右到左读得到的结果是一样的。任意给定一个字符串，通过插入若干字符，都可以变成一个回文词。你的任务是写一个程序，求出将给定字符串变成回文词所需插入的最少字符数。比如字符串“Ab3bd”，在插入两个字符后可以变成一个回文词（“dAb3bAd”或“Adb3bdA”）。然而，插入两个以下的字符无法使它变成一个回文词。给出一个字符串求出使其变为回文串需要插入的最少字符数。 思路：需要添加的字符的长度为原字符串的总长度减去现有的回文串长度，所以只要求出原字符串的回文串的长度就可以解决了回文串的定义是正串与反串一样，那么正串与反串的最长公共子序列长度就是回文串的长度为什么不是最长公共子串长度？ 在添加字符的时候可以在任意位置插入，所以不必要求连续。所以如果只能从左右两边加入，那么就是最长公共子串长度 乘积最大 设有一个长度为N的数字串，要求选手使用K个乘号将它分成K+1个部分，找出一种分法，使得这K+1个部分的乘积能够为最大。如：有一个数字串：312， 当N=3，K=1时会有以下两种分法： 1） 312=36 2） 312=62这时，符合题目要求的结果是：31*2=62 状态：f[i][j]表示前i位使用k个乘号的最大乘积决策： 这个数与前面的数组成更大的数，需要枚举这个数的起点 单独成为一个新数 在算乘积的时候可以先算出前缀‘乘’转移方程: for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++) muti[i]*=muti[i-1]*a[i];muti[0]=1;for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++)for(int j=1;j&lt;=k;j++){ f[i][j]=f[i-1][j-1]*a[i]; for(int k=1;k&lt;i;k++)

2018年，终是不平凡的一年。身处在新旧交替的此刻，脑海里跃现着2018年的点点滴滴，汗水与泪水、希望与失望，成功与失败……仿佛都没有那么重要了，重要的是此刻，经历时间的冒险，我终于来到了这里，来到了2019年的启幕。 也许，我还是中考彻夜未眠的我，却也一笔一划地书写出了青春最美的篇章；也许，我还是电脑前苦思冥想的我，却一字一字敲击出了梦想坚强的力量；也许，我还是初次坐在高中教室里的我，满是对未来的憧憬。时间，总是动人的力量，一切仿佛都在上一秒刚刚发生，另一切却又像是在未知的下一秒即将发生。 征程总是在路上，希望总是在远方。犹记得备战中考的日子，犹记得与同学之间相互激励，相互进步的每一天。当记忆被时间模糊，历久弥新的是这美好的情谊，我相信，对我而言，这是一笔珍贵的财富，不再的财富。而如今，向往与憧憬变为了现实，我来到了这里，来到了高新一中。迎着改革开放四十周年的春风，我也踏上了新的征程，迎来了新的挑战。 热爱我的热爱。中考后的第二天，我来到了这里，结识了信息学竞赛的学长们，在教练的指导下开始了新的学习。计算机科学，像是一座冰山缓缓突破海平面，从视野里一个点到覆盖了整个视野，有如此多的新知等待我去探索，此刻，心潮澎湃。我的热爱，能够更深地热爱。我坚信，这份热爱终将成为梦想的锋芒。 道阻且长，行则将至。茫然，始终伴随着我；舍得，总是让我无措。我依旧在努力寻找那个最好的自己，在时间的平衡木上找到最佳的那一点，在情绪的池沼里小心前行，在思维的隧洞中向深处继续挖掘。需要去做的，还有很多很多，奔跑不能停止，生活不止眼前的苟且，还有诗和远方。 任何组织和个人，达到某个临界点时，都需要自我刷新。拥抱同理心，培养‘无所不学’的求知欲，以及建立成长型思维是拥抱智能时代自我刷新的三个重要步骤”。 这是我的偶像，微软CEO萨提亚·纳德拉在《刷新》一书中所提到的。 刷新，并不意味着推翻重来，而是有目的、有针对性地调整。2018年，微软公司通过“刷新”，超越苹果成为了全球市值最高的公司。2019年，更是我需要刷新的一年。

因此这个点取或者不取，带来的贡献就是两种情况的差，所以我们只要按两种情况的差从大到小排序就好了。最后选取差值最大的k-1个点就OK了（前提是这k-1个点带来的贡献都是正的，如果有负贡献那么就取不满k-1个点） $dp[u][0][1]$：父亲不取，自己要取，儿子取k条边","link":"/2019/01/29/树形DP/"},{"title":"汉诺塔问题","text":"题面

演讲环节结束后，我鬼使神差般居然举起了手，也可能是太激动了，问题都没有想好。起身后，Will让我使用翻译提问。“首先请允许我表达我对微软以及您的敬意”，当这句话瞬间以英文的形式呈现在大屏幕上时，我第一次感到，最前沿的科技可以为我所用，真正对我的现实生活产生一定的好的影响，我认为这是微软带给每一个人、每一个组织真正的生产力。 也许只有在GIX，我才有这样的机会，和梦想中的企业专家面对面交流。 创新挑战赛讲台的前方，已经排起了长龙似的队伍——排队抽签，也许是最激动人心的时刻了。轮到我了，我搓了搓双手，在抽签箱里拿出了那一张等候已久的小组号码。 又是一群有想法、有创意、有能力的组员，很高兴我们组成了一个新的Team。 下午的头脑风暴，是一场思维的盛宴。我们组很平静，很理性，在经过了20分钟的个人思考之后，我们聚在一起，在偌大的白板上写出了属于我们自己的idea，我仿佛能看见，一条条思维的变换曲线在空中交汇纵横，构成五彩斑斓的魅力图案。 明天又是“艰苦卓绝”的一天，4组加油，GIX加油！ 2019年2月13日

整个早上的一半时间我都在搭建项目网页，无非就是一些图片添加，文字复制粘贴，视频上传一系列按部就班的工作。也顺带把图标设计、组名、标语等一系列杂七杂八的次要任务全部完成了。当域名成功访问、当创意鲜明的logo大功告成的时候，还是有那么一些小激动，之前都是访问别人的酷炫项目网页，而今天，也终于轮到了自己，为整个小组搭好“门面”。 另一半时间，遨游于面包板的海洋，在赤橙黄绿青蓝紫的连接线里来回穿梭……这也许是我第一次写这么长的代码（对各位大佬而言不值一提），看着舵机疯狂地旋转、跑马灯胡乱地闪亮以及蜂鸣器肆无忌惮地聒噪，debug的过程也是一种难得的享受。 黑色的下午……我们组的3D打印件似乎出了一些问题，密封性和传动性都达不到预期。展示的亚克力底板还是一片空白，心里有点空虚。功夫不负有心人，我们组的机械大佬最终硬是用最原始的工具解决了最棘手的问题，本人佩服得五体投地。 晚上，我的任务是完成一些组件连接任务。为了连接舵机和转轴，手上沾满了强力胶，似乎手已经不是我自己的了。热熔胶把垫板烫得千疮百孔，就像是月球一个个陨石坑一样。 明天早上就要去微软了，那里于我而言就像是耶路撒冷于信教徒一般，是梦想之地。是时候充值一波信仰了…… GIX 2019冬令营学员 李昊锦 2019年2月14日晚于Bellevue Coast Hotel","link":"/2019/02/14/西雅图-Day6/"},{"title":"随机数基本使用方法","text":"基本公式：要取得[a,b)的随机整数，使用(rand() %

然后就是微软展览馆和纪念品店。真的是十分激动，亲眼看到了surface studio，亲自试听了surface headphone，再看看价钱，真香！ 在纪念品商店，看到了很多印有logo的周边，马上就要到集合时间了，我见到中意的衣服就拿，还有一个巨大无比的购物袋。最后结账的时候看着金额噌噌噌往上涨，心在滴血啊。还是放回去了一些小东西。最后提着大包小包上车了。但还是迟到了，耽误了大家的行程，真的很抱歉。但是看着信仰充值成功，终于拥有了正版的微软周边，也还是很开心的。希望这些东西能够成为一些念想，希望每当看到这些，总能想起我的梦想，想起这家伟大的公司。

Downtown，偶尔有几只海鸥紧贴地面飞翔，看着远处的云朵被阳光穿透，一点一点地朝我们照来。一切都很安静，一切都很和谐，站在这里，吹着海风，一切烦恼都被抛在脑后，只希望这一刻可以永远持续下去…… 下午很早就回到了酒店，然后换正装前往晚宴地点。乘坐电梯上至高层，来到了我们的晚宴地点。这里真的好高端啊，落地窗户直接可以看到整个西雅图（贝尔维尤？）市中心，风景十分美。 待大家坐定，没想到第一个环节就是激动人心的颁奖环节。也没有什么像电视节目中一秒剪成20秒的做作，仅仅只是丁老师平和地说出了获奖的优秀项目团队。当“Reflux”这个词说出来后，我的心跳就突然加快，我意识到也许是我们！仅仅一瞬之后，我确定是我们，就是我们！我们TinySoft这一组可能是最奇葩的一组了。三天挑战赛所有组员都没有熬夜，基本没有争吵，没有喝一杯咖啡，总之我们非常平常地坚持下来了，感觉所有项目环节也是稳步推进，一步一个脚印。但我们也未曾想过，第一名会是我们，这真的是一件意料之中却又是意料之外的事情。丁老师话音刚落，我激动地挥舞双手，不由自主地站了起来，看了看老师，看了看我的队友，又坐了下去，不知所措的样子…… 几次非常尴尬地站起坐下后，我们组的四个人，机械大佬邰潇逸、视频大佬田成洋、文案大佬文劼还有我、李昊锦一同站在了舞台上（其实没有舞台）。当我看见台下Lewis鼓励的目光，以及老师们祝贺的目光，再环顾光晕下我们四人，百感交集。也许就是缘分，让我们相聚，让我们都在彼此的人生线上都有了交集。头脑风暴，我们一同站在风暴中心大开脑洞；三天的挑战，我们并肩前行，无畏困难。 我从未想过三天不到的时间，我们能够从相识相知到相互理解、相互支持；从想法到现实；从争执分歧到统一团结……我发现了自己的潜能，发现了团队的精神所在，就像许斌校长所说：“个人主义如今已不复存在”，是的，我们团队中的每一个人都是不可或缺的，缺少任何人我们的项目都是无法达到现在的高度的。感谢每一位组员，让我在这个大部分高二年级的集体中找到了自己的定位，更好地去施展自己的特长，去为项目更尽一份力。 优秀营员，这真的是我从未预料到的。我们组的独特之处还在于我们并没有推选Team Leader，而是各司其职，当有工作需要对接时，则由双方或者全体成员共同完成。当然，最终逐渐地、自然地，邰潇逸同学成为了我们各个工作对接的指挥者。我觉得这是很好的一种机制，在我们都不了解各自的擅长领域、不“服气”各自的擅长领域的时候，我们停下来，仔细分工，各自放开手去做，自然地，到了对接的地方，就能体现出各自的长处。也感谢我们这一自然而然形成的机制，让我的编程技能也有了施展的空间。我想，这也许就是我能够成为优秀营员的原因吧，一个好的团队，一个高效率的协作机制。 其实我们整个挑战赛过程还是蛮惬意的，笑声是常有的。还记得我们在最终测试RHWSS时，由于阀门的密封性问题，水流动之后，就像洪灾一样，水从三个阀门处毫不吝啬地流出。我们用纸杯在阀门下节水，整个装置固定在一张亚克力板上，向右偏，右边阀门的水顺利流进纸杯，而左边就遭殃了。我们又用餐巾纸强行堵住漏水的地方，真的是四个人都措手不及，拆东墙补西墙，我们便笑边“治水”，莫名其妙地沉浸在漏水的欢乐中…… 继续说晚宴吧，这真的是超乎我想象的一场晚宴。美味的牛排已经是次要的了，各个班的同学们并不完美却饱含创意的展示、老师们出乎意料的彩蛋节目，以及彩蛋中的彩蛋，都让我们每个人十分兴奋，全场的掌声、欢呼声经久不息。just enjoy it，我无法知道我们是否还能再相遇，但只要享受此刻，我们终究会存在于对方最深的记忆当中，GIX，会成为我内心最深处那一片净地。完强老师一首接着一首，大家一遍一遍地欢呼，对我而言，这是最难忘的记忆。当country road想起，我想起了父亲的老唱片，想起了父亲一遍又一遍的仔细聆听，也许此刻，我能设身处地地感受到父亲的内心，这是一种难以言喻的情感，有不舍、有留恋、有遗憾、有宠幸、有一切我们最柔软的情感…… 晚宴结束，我基本上跟每一位能碰见的老师、同学都合影留念，我害怕这一刻过得太快，不愿一眨眼我已经回到学校的课桌板凳之中。我怀念这里的一切，怀念创新的感觉，并不是老师教授给我们的，而是我们自己去发现的，去被激发出来的，这是GIX的神奇之处，她让我不知不觉感觉创新就在我的指尖滑动，在一个个思维里跃现。 最后，我收到了本班同学的小卡片以及很多留言祝福。我真的没想到，在这里能遇见你们，不仅是因为各位是全国最优秀的中学生，各位更是给予我信任的人，给予我鼓励与关爱的人，很难再遇见像你们一样可爱的人了。 “祝你和微软百年好合”，这是江同学的调侃，在我看来，是对我的一种肯定，对我所坚持的、所向往的、所追求的梦想的肯定。来到西雅图，很主要的一个原因是因为这里是微软总部，我作为一个疯狂的微软粉丝，这里自然就是我的朝圣之地。我爱微软，不只是因为这是一家改变世界的超大规模跨国公司，更是因为她成功转型背后的文化力量、她在各种领域的风险。很高兴，在这里认识了微软机器翻译专家Lewis Will，第一次见到Lewis时，我已是兴奋不已，他还没有开始演讲，我就跑过去和他交流，甚至都没有组织好语言，对微软的崇拜，对微软技术的好奇，对Lewis的敬意，像流水一般哗啦哗啦地迸发，却在嘴边停了下来，变得磕磕绊绊，不知所措。而Lewis则非常友好，询问我的姓名，问我来自哪里，我只记得我在不断重复“I really love Microsoft”，有些话就在嘴边，却总是无法说出口。当他演讲结束，我又不受控制地高高举起了手，甚至连问题都不知道…… 第二次再见Lewis，是在项目展示的那天，Lewis作为评委出席。在中午休息期间，我在卫生间碰到了他，真的很意外Lewis居然记住了我的中文名字，他询问我是第几组，我如实回答。没敢再多说什么，走回教室帮助组员熟悉展示过程。 当我们展示完，我看见Lewis高高举起了他的手，就像是那天发言我高高举起的双手一样，泪水差一点从眼眶里涌出来……“Why did your team name is Tinysoft”，我看见大家都笑了，而邰同学拿起话筒笑着说：“Because this man really love Microsoft”，我也尴尬地笑了起来，但对我而言，我很自豪再一次能够把我和微软联系再一起。 第三次见到Lewis，就是在晚宴上，我看见大家都拿起高脚杯去各个桌“敬酒”，我也不能落下啊。我先去找了Lewis，或者说直接就碰到了他，他又一次完整地叫出了我的中文名，我向他表达感谢之情，感谢他对我的鼓励，对我们项目的支持与建议。甚至，Lewis让我加了他的微信！我真的很激动，微信联系人的第一个真正的外国人，第一个微软专家，这是我求之不得的。希望，我们能一直保持联系，希望微软，一直前进下去。 此时此刻，我正坐在Bellevue Coast Hotel的大厅里，听着单曲循环的Conuntry Road，用着Markdown，敲击一个个键帽，为西雅图之行写下最后的美好回忆。本来想着总结一下晚宴，莫名其妙写到了这里。第一次感觉到“文字是内心真实的流露”。旁边坐着补作业的同学，还有吃夜宵的摄影师老师，望望窗外，是西雅图最后的夜晚。 GIX2019冬令营学员 李昊锦 2019年2月19日凌晨于Coast Hotel","link":"/2019/02/18/The-last-day-in-seattle/"},{"title":"Summary of 2019 VEX Worlds Championship","text":"VEX 2019世锦赛总结 难忘的一次经历。 久别重逢作为刚刚转入国际班的新生，我很荣幸被韩老师选中参加VEX2019世锦赛。赛前，有激动、欣喜，也有紧张与茫然。VEX，于我而言是一个既熟悉又陌生的竞赛项目。初中时在韩老师的带领下参加了“一网打尽”和“星光璀璨”两个赛季，也收获了很多。本以为与VEX在此分道扬镳，没想到如今的久别重逢。与熟悉的金属结构件相遇、与机器人对抗电机高速旋转的齿轮声相遇，更重要的，更重要的是与初中时有着共同热爱与梦想的同学们和老师重逢。这一切都让我激动不已，就像是星星之火在无数个暴风雪夜之后重新成为熊熊烈火一样，照亮了我的心。 当然，新的问题接踵而至。VEX推出了全新的V5主控套装，新的编程环境，这一切都是需要我去学习和尽快掌握新的知识；这里有了更多陌生的面孔，有身经百战的学姐和学长、还有已经征战将近一个赛季的国一的同学们。而我，作为一个新加入机器人社团大家庭的人，如何让大家认识我、了解我、信任我是亟待解决的问题。 在赛前，我努力地尝试编写自动程序，当小球被精准地吸入机器人的储球仓时、当小球射中旗杆的那一刹那，那种久违的激动与喜悦再次涌上心头，每一行代码，都是自己思考过后的体现，每一次正确编译和执行，都有着小小的成就感。 我找回了那种感觉，拾起了彼时的梦想，找寻到了志同道合的朋友们。同时也学习了新的知识，结识了新的朋友，更有了新的体悟。 我们在一起 高新一中机器人社团是一个整体，我们代表的不仅是个人，而是整个社团，整个学校甚至中国。每一个人都是这个集体的一份子，我们的行为会对整个集体产生影响。 无论坐飞机，坐大巴，整理比赛器械，参加比赛，我们都在一起。启程的那一天晚上，杨子逸、李恺峰和其他几个学长一起在整理东西，我看见每一个人都仔细地寻找需要的零件，彼此认真核对，最后整齐地放入行李箱。我看见党一然学长一丝不苟地为机器人安装保护架，最后用防震材料小心翼翼地将机器人放入箱子里。而此时，是凌晨两点。我看到所有的人各司其职、所有的步骤稳步推进。作为新成员，我第一次感到，我们真的是一个集体。 办理超大件行李托运的同学不用着急，因为他们知道，我们会在安检处耐心地等待他们；坐在飞机后面的同学下机不用着急，因为他们知道，我们会在国际到达最显眼的地方等着他们。我们，不会孤单，我们有彼此。我们，有共同的期许与愿望。 白天当地时间，晚上北京时间作为社团的新成员，我本以为此次比赛我的任务只限于看场地、管理电池，一个队伍8个人是完全冗余的状态。但实际上在整个比赛过程中，有太多的事情需要去做，只要主动，总会有需要自己做的事情，并不只是老师所分配的任务。队伍中的每一个人找准自己的定位是极其重要的。 VEX 比赛中，联队的联络是非常重要的。有时候学姐需要去练习场或者打技能赛的时候，我就主动去帮助学姐联络接下来的联队。既可以更加熟悉VEX 的比赛规则，了解整个分区的其他队伍，又可以锻炼自己的英语水平。 当然，熬夜是逃不过的。最开始我也在抱怨，为什么搭建临时场地的是我们国一年级，熬夜摆场地帮助学长调自动程序的也是我们。学长学姐也是这样过来的，没有谁可以只去做最重要的事情。一个团队想要成功，必须有人愿意去做累的、无聊的、重复的事情。而在这个过程中，也是一种锻炼，当我知道原来还原比赛场地要一分一毫追求标准时，未来我编写自动程序时就会按照这个标准严格执行；当我熟悉了如何快速搭建场地，掌握了搭建场地的细节，我就会知道如何去更加高效容易的得分。当场地图纸深深地印在脑海里时，会简化很多原本复杂的工作。 比赛开始的第一天，有可能是我还不适应比赛节奏，晚上回到酒店到头就睡，可以说是精疲力尽。看到国一的其他同学都帮助学长们调程序到很晚，我也很不好意思，无地自容。第二天，依旧很累。记得最清楚的是韩老师的一句话：“大家都很累，每个人都走了上万步，没有谁是不累的。只是心里有根弦紧绷着，清楚地知道自己有任务没有完成，才会一直坚持下去”。那天晚上，一直在场地帮忙摆场地。记得稍微在场地上躺了1分钟就睡着了，醒来时看见每个人还都在做自己该做的事情。场地一遍一遍地还原、代码一次又一次地修改下载、电机一遍又一遍地驱动，可正是在这个无限循环的过程中，诞生了最好的机器人，最稳定的自动程序，最强大的一只队伍。 由于需要在比赛中切换操纵手，而使用V4定义双手柄的方法并不适用于V5，我和另一个学长何林睿开始上网查找有关V5双操的信息。但由于是新产品，整个信息资源十分有限，我也咨询了在比赛中认识的外国队伍，可是直到最后也没有找到合适的解决方案。我们只能按照主控和单手柄的定义方式尝试定义双手柄。“primary”和“partner”这两个词语，已经永远地印刻在了我的脑海里，那一句定义代码永远也不会忘记。虽然只是简简单单的一行代码，可对我而言，这是我和学长凭着自己的努力，按照规范自己想出来的。这与说明文档上已经给出的语句是不一样的。这一句，我们永远不会忘记，以后碰见类似的情况也一定会自己解决。虽然说最后双操程序出了些问题，但我还是非常开心，毕竟自己熬夜写出了基本的思路和代码。学长和老师能够信任我，给予我机会去尝试，是对我莫大的鼓励与肯定。 同样，我也不会想到，我的自动程序会派上用场。由于两份源代码所有的电机定义都不一样，而又要同时使用两份源代码的自动和手动程序，我只好用define语句替换关键字。如果不是韩老师之前在编程课上提及过，如果不是自己下来查找过详细用法，我永远不会想到这样的方法。有时候，编程的小技巧却能够大大提高编程效率。而这些技巧，就是需要不断在日常的编写中与同学和老师们的交流，在网上查找的过程中来获取的。 那天晚上，韩老师一直陪我到最后。关闭主机、拔下电池、插上充电线、关上灯，和韩老师一起离开。在那个转角处，我看见韩老师的背影，有一种难以言喻的感觉。刷房卡，按下扳手，室友早已熟睡。看看表，已是凌晨五点，洗个澡，静静地看着太阳从远处升起，又是疲惫而又充实的一天。 榜样我很敬佩社团里的每一个人，他们让这个社团成为了一个真正的社团。 韩老师，最值得我敬佩的人。带着热爱与希望，度过了每一个夜晚，还有更多我们不知道的困难。再多的话语都显得苍白无力，老师您辛苦了！这是我内心最真实的流露。 学姐，作为老社长，每一次人员的集合、解散，房间的分配都是学姐负责。整个社团在她的安排下总是井井有条。住到新酒店之后，还没有等我们找到自己的房间，学姐就把所有人的房间号全部记录好并发送到微信群里了。很简单的工作，却是最重要，最容易忽视的工作。记得学姐每天早上的人工叫醒，当我迷迷糊糊地接电话时，学姐早已经起床洗漱完毕，提醒其他人起床了。 杨子逸和李恺峰学长，两个人形影不离，经常被我们拍到靠在一起呼呼大睡的照片。但是两个人确实最有默契的，666U整个队伍在两位学长的带领下一路披荆斩棘，闯入复赛。杨子逸学长调程序时，李恺峰学长在旁边提出自己的建议，李恺峰学长练习操纵时，杨子逸学长也会很中肯地提出建议。我认为这是最好的学习方式，相互学习，共同进步。虚心接受他人的建议，敢于去站在整个团队的立场上向别人提出建议都不是容易的事情，但两位学长都做到了，而且做的很好、很成功。 樊金同学，作为国一唯一一个女生，却为团队贡献了很多。赛前的工程日志，我看见每次社团课和晚自习的空余时间，都是她一个人一丝不苟地画图、写字、排版。虽然没有能够取得全能奖，但这份70多页沉甸甸的工程日志值得我们每一个人细细翻阅，它饱含着樊金同学对于整个团队的认真付出。在比赛的过程中，樊金同学清晰明了的对战分析和情报收集也是我需要学习的。每一场比赛，对手队友，时间地点，以及队友对手的各个比赛场次她都全面地一一罗列。一个人静静地坐在看台上录下每一场队友对手的比赛，并仔细分析。 不止他们，社团里的每一个人都值得我学习，每一个人都有自己的艰辛，每一个人都为整个团队付出了许多，我们每一个人让社团不断向前进步。 真正的意义还没有来到比赛场地，没有走进Freedom Hall的时候，我一直都在思考，自己此行的目的究竟是什么。最开始，我认为要竭尽自己所能，帮助团队取得最好的成绩。可当推着箱子走进灯光璀璨的比赛场地时，当站在凳子上将国旗高高悬挂在队伍的展板上时，当对面的陌生人主动向我问好时，VEX 比赛成绩对我来说已经不重要了，重要的是在这个世界性的舞台上展示自己，展示中国。大胆地、勇敢地去和来自全世界各地的、不同文化、不同信仰、不同价值观的同龄人交流、学习、共同进步。比赛只是一个很好的形式，技术的切磋必定伴随着广泛的交流。 第一天，也不知绕着整个场地转了多少圈，满怀着激动的心情。我看见身着奇装异服的队伍、我看见糖果铺满的队伍……机器人对于他们来说只是这次比赛的一个方面，他们创新新奇的思维不止体现在机器人的构建上，而是方方面面。这种开放和发散思维是我需要学习的，用于向他人展示自己、展示自己价值观所认同的东西。 这一次比赛，是我用英语交流最多的一次。哪怕把“autonomous”这个单词一直读错发音，依然不影响我们的交流，敢于开口，敢于交流是我学到的最重要的东西。 我认识了德克萨斯州热情的Dover, 我们谈论了很多中美的差异问题，简单的问题却联系起了两个异国人；我认识了来自阿联酋的小胖，宗教从来不是阻碍我们交流的原因；我认识了纽约州两个初中男孩和他们的父亲，兄弟两人在爸爸的教导下已经参加VEX比赛3年了；我认识了来自英国伦敦的一群可爱的朋友，甚至询问他们关于脱欧“Brexit”的看法；更加幸运的是，我认识了来自华盛顿州西雅图的Emrecs, 他的父亲在微软总部从事Onenote的开发工作。我们坐在看台上聊了很久，我从未想过能遇到与自己一样热爱微软的他。这真的是一次极其难得的机会，我能够认识来自全世界各地的同龄人，用着同一种语言，表达自己的思想。交流，真的是一件很美妙的事情。 现在的我，更加热爱VEX机器人竞赛，它对我而言有了更加深刻的意义。 坐在飞往北京的客机上，下方是白茫茫一片的北极。心中真的有一种淡淡的忧伤，不舍得这里的每一个人，每一个不眠的夜晚，每一场精彩绝伦的机器人对抗。 之前每一次出国，都是夏令营、冬令营活动。一群素不相识的陌生人从相识到相知，却难免要分开，只能将美好的回忆珍藏在心底。而这一次，同样是与并不熟悉的同学们相识相知，我们却可以继续一同努力，延续这一份难得的友谊，在下一个赛季携手再创辉煌。这是令我最为激动的事情，各位，一起加油！","link":"/2019/04/29/Summary-of-2019-VEX-Worlds-Championship/"},{"title":"西雅图-Day2","text":"失败的咖啡

cuts diamond为slogan，戮力同心，风雨同舟。 张珺奕：从中国坐了半天的交通工具，飞机地铁大巴轮番上阵，弄得我有些晕地。我们先参观了现代化的充满科技感的全球创新学院大楼，见识到了许多有趣而不乏智慧的作品，感受到了创新前所未有的魅力。刚到美国第一天就受到强烈冲击的我生物钟有些紊乱。 早上三点，我忽然醒来，看了表便又倒头就睡。上午举行了开营仪式，聆听了知名人物的介绍与展望。下午组织了小队的建立，我还没太多经验。希望它会使十个各行其道的灵魂，在彼此唯一的一生中团结起来，干点惊天动地的大事！ 赵冠迪：也就刚来美国两天，却遇上40年不遇的大雪，GIX的大楼整个被飘动的飞雪掩盖在寒风中。这却并不影响我们的ice-breaking。 Teamwork，作为备受强调的第一点，在今天，开始体现其重要性。其实现在任何一个创新举动的背后，都站着一个乐意付出的群体。团队是有效率的不二良策。几天时间很短也很长，团队可能遇到各种问题，放平心态，大家一定可以解决。beta组加油！ 刘子政：这次冬令营的主题是三个词：Team，Independence，Rules。Team，意味着我们要有团队意识，我们要形成一个团队；Independence，意味着我们要自立，真正离开父母的依赖而生活；Rules，意味着我们做事要有原则，时刻记住规则并时刻遵守。之前我们可能听说过相关的词，但是直到这次冬令营，才对这三个词的含义有了深刻的理解，也懂得了如何去真正践行这三个词。同时，我们也了解了世界上仍然存在一些亟待解决的问题：UI，商业管理，水资源危机，生物多样性危机。这次冬令营教给我们的东西，比十年的学校生活教给我们的知识还要多得多，重要得多。下午，当老师交给我们任务时，我原本以为不能在很短的时间内完成，但是经过团队的合作之后，我们才发现，团队合作的效率，远远要比一个人单打独斗效率要高很多。beta这个名字是大家共同努力的结果，希望我们都能为beta队助一份力！ 王业成：经过十个小时漫长的飞行，我们在2月9日上午十点到达了西雅图塔科马机场，随后乘车前往西雅图，开启了这次gix冬令营的行程。行程的首站是参观gix大楼。和国内一些大学的教学楼相比，gix大楼的内饰极为简单，并且教室的面积相对有限，而更多的面积则摆放着提供给学生的各种实践用到的工具以及一个小型的孵化器，这让我感受到了gix重视实践的学风，也让我明白了创新不等于空想，实践方能出真知。 第二天上午学校举办了几场有关创新的讲座，让我们初步了解了技术创新在不同领域的重要价值。下午学校组织了简单的团队建设活动，帮助我们理解了团队合作的真正内涵：一个团队可以存异，但更重要的是求同，否则teamwork当中一加一大于二的效应也就无从谈起。相信在这段时间不断的互相了解与合作中，我们的beta团队能够克服各种困难，成为一个更加团结稳定的集体。 向家骅：二十年一遇的西雅图大雪骤至，带来了雪树银花的景色，但更具现实意义的是使得一天的活动都在室内举行。无论是上午的guest speech or下午的团建，都是能发人深思的体验。 史元春校长作为第一个guest来 deliver a speech，向我们展示了interface发展历史中的里程碑及其所基于的技术创新。其中特意提到了使得计算机得以普遍使用的关键创新—mouse以及其所起到推动效应的graphical use interface及natural use interface. Natural interface作为人机交互最前沿的阶段，具有convenient的优点及输入准确性较低的缺点。而基于此的创新又有许多，如将手指与触屏所施压强与字母建立映射，并以此形成输入法。 这能有效克服触碰不精确的问题。又有外用导电材料构建外延键盘等，种种都反映了创新是多方面的，以解决问题也目的。我们绝不是innovate for innovation 而是 innovate to meet the need of society。第三位guest同样提到这一点。 至于下午的团建，起初因为意见不一导致的来回拉锯而效率不佳，但后期采用了不同的探讨方法使得问题得到有效解决。老师同样提到，一个team应该形成一股凝聚力，为这一个目标而发力，并以一致的行为实现它。 俞逸洋：在难得一遇的银装素裹的西雅图，我看到了作为一个北方人都极为罕见的大雪；我参观了充满着各种用来帮助我们创新创造的器具的GIX大楼，惊叹于其外观的宏伟与内部的开阔；我聆听了来自GIX的史院长、亚马逊的杨总监、GIX的副院长和在GIX学习的学生Ben为我们带来的有关他们各自所做的一些研究的演讲，令我受益匪浅。我了解到了一些以前并没有太多接触的事物，如那么多的输入方式、配送中心机器人的用途等，也听到了一些以前涉及过一点的内容，发现自己学过的东西只是皮毛而已；我还有幸结识了这样一群来自五湖四海的优秀的同学们，用了将近一下午一起讨论了team的名字、口号、组徽，并定下了从beta版升级到正式版的目标，牢记强中更有强中手的警句。哲学告诉我们，系统优化就是系统作为一个整体，具有它的每一个要素都不能单独具有的功能。我想这就是teamwork吧——一个凝聚力强的团队一起朝一个方向努力的同时每个人都发挥出自己的特长，共同奋进，达成目标。愿我们的beta团队能同心协力，破路之棘，虚心求学，砥砺前行！ 江楚萌：伴随着声声悠扬的清华版《成都》的，是与63位同行的营员和十几位老师初次相遇。面对着许多陌生的面孔，在最初是很有一些紧张的——尤其是看到左边的同学在等待的期间仍一直在学习着庞杂的代码的时候。然而，在经过十个小时的飞机旅程中与身边同学的初步接触后，我发现，大家都是十分热情的人，刻苦但不刻板。 初见西雅图的第一眼，是一片茫茫白雪，从空中望去，纯洁的白绵延至天际，竟是在北京也许多年不曾见到的大雪了。到酒店下大巴之后，身边的同学迅速裹起了一个大大的雪球，抛了出去，随意裹起的雪球有些松散，在半空中便纷纷扬扬地散开了，化成片片雪花落下，不禁让人莞尔。下午，我们参观了GIX大楼，大楼的装修很像一个扩大版的loft，铁皮楼梯、无纺布拼成的GIX字样，灰色高靠背沙发，简约而精致。 今天上午，我们迎来了4位speaker，分别为我们介绍了HCI和Technology在Amazon、保护Water Resource和Biodiversity中的应用。从中，我真正感受到，在当今这个时代下，人们做出的许多Big Decision都是基于各种数据，而不再是人们的经验了。下午，我们进行了第一次的“小组交流”，也就是团建活动。在第一个四十分钟中，老师首先给我们布置了一个任务，而后在每隔一段时间的时候，都会做出一定的变更，这让我想到，是否在现实生活中，我们在做一个项目的时候也会面临这种问题，需要根据现实的发展来调整自己的目标或者增加一定的内容呢？我们Beta组的小伙伴们在最初的交流中屡有不顺，然而在经过一开始的磨合之后，在第二个四十分钟之中，我们或许已经摸到了些许“求同存异”的边，交流效率高了许多。相信在未来的九天中，我们一定会更加合拍，共同进步！ 张钰坤：飞掠阿拉斯加的时候，放下kindle，你顺着机窗往斜前看，是正要初升的朝阳。你再向外看的时候，飞机已经降落到云层里面，破过迷雾，身下是灰白分界，一边是水域，另一边是换上冬装的大地。积上雪的松树，真的很美。你知道，我好多年没看过这么大的雪了。 这就是我第一次遇上西雅图，那一瞥。 在GIX大楼里，一层有独特的圆桌教室，讲台在中央，学生众星拱月。二层有设施齐全的创客空间：各种各型号电子元件、3D打印、激光切割。三层有学生工作室，上面陈列着各种未竟之业。GIX大楼色调很清淡、很素雅，点点的标识，格式灰色座椅，让人感到一种设计感。 在这座楼里和我一起学习生活的2组，让我觉得我们有一个共性：聪明而又努力。无论成绩好坏，至少给我感觉，大家都是认真的。但这不足以使人精彩。真正吸引我的，是有人性格上的可爱纯真，有的人生活上的悉心精致。它让我们有血有肉、不枯燥。 GIX大楼一层有一个清华厅，一进去你就能看见那座仿制的日晷，清华园里那座，是99年前毕业的清华学子敬献的。“行胜于言”就刻在它的基座上。我想那一代人，会很不幸吧——军阀混战，内外交困，新工业、新政体、新文化，都革命性的起起落落。将近一百年过去了，一百年前，那群不幸而坚强的人告诉我们，去笃定地做事。一百年来，它是否也成为一种文化，影响着听到它、内心就多少泛起波澜的人呢？我们不甘做地缝里的虫子，所以敢有梦想；但我们往往遇到生活中各种各样你须面对的掣肘，怎么办呢？“行胜于言”告诉我们：不犹豫、不抱怨，高效应对琐事，去赢得时间。“行胜于言”代表一种清华文化。清华厅把它带进了GIX。 GIX第一届毕业生Ben的讲座里提到了一种模式：design-business-technology。努力做创新、做产品，以此来做高新产业，推动技术进步。个人价值与社会价值平等：努力，为了国家，也为了自己。是不是更尊重人才呢？ 优质的条件、优秀的队友、优良的文化：那雪中的一见钟情，是不是上帝有意为之？ 唐启航：这是一次极不平凡的清华GIX之旅，我有机会向如此多的优秀校领导，老师，同学们共同学习进步。 这是一次极不平凡的Seattle创新之旅，我有机会明白了不仅要come up with ideas 更要学会将之carry out 并 review its feedback。 这是一次极不平凡的中美励志之旅，我有机会明白了我们这一代人的使命绝不仅仅在于自身的发展，更要将展现清华风采，进步社会，发展祖国的任务抗在肩上。并为之不懈努力奋斗。 正像“法华经‘中所说：功不唐捐，玉汝于成。 李昊锦：万万没有想到，是全新的波音787梦想客机。再一次踏上美国的旅程，却怀着更高的愿景与期待。轰鸣的引擎声就像激动的内心一样，久久无法平复。依着舷窗眺望，我看到了如锦的晚霞，看到了绯红的朝霞，看到了银装素裹的西雅图——一方神奇的土地。 万万没有想到，是大雪纷飞的时节。夏季，这里热情似火，让我感受到了梦想与未来在这里的电石火光。冬季，这里宁静安然，西雅图这座城市，就这样静静地倚在太平洋西海岸，吸引着无数像我一样对这里心驰神往的人们。 万万没有想到，是史蒂夫·鲍尔默大楼。对于一名微软粉丝来说，这就是最大的惊喜。“Enpower every person and organization to achieve more”，予力全球每一个人、每一个人成就不凡，这是微软的使命，我相信也是GIX所倡导的。期待着，在这栋充满智慧与创新的地方，我能成为那个受益良多的人。 万万没有想到，是这样一群可爱的、踊跃的、充满创意的组员。在Team Building中，我们灵感飞扬，在小小的圆桌上，思想在不断地碰撞与融合。作为第二组“Beta”小组的组长，我相信，通过每一位组员的努力，我们携手共进，定能让“Beta”版本成为“正式发行版”。 西雅图，有更多的文化精神等待我们去发现；GIX，有更多的知识技能等待我们去学习。我们，正在创造属于自己的未来，奔向属于自己的梦想！ 班主任刘禹廷老师：这批学生虽然因为年龄缘故还尚显稚嫩，但已经比我预想的好很多。你们大多是独生子女，做到“独”并不难。但是，独立的重点在于“立”。异国他乡，成功挑战一场艰难的任务高度依赖每个个体的成熟和在此基础上的紧密无间的团队合作，希望孩子们能够尽快进入状态，用行动证明，你们的优秀不只是用语言和证书堆砌出来的。加油！ 十天的清华GIX之旅才刚刚起步，我们的Beta小组也方扬帆起航，相信在剩下的九天里，我们会学到更多未曾闻见的知识，我们也会更加了解彼此，扬长避短，求同存异，砥砺奋进，并肩前行！","link":"/2019/02/10/西雅图-Day2/"}],"tags":[{"name":"life","slug":"life","link":"/tags/life/"},{"name":"DIY","slug":"DIY","link":"/tags/DIY/"},{"name":"日记","slug":"日记","link":"/tags/日记/"},{"name":"Dairy","slug":"Dairy","link":"/tags/Dairy/"},{"name":"motor","slug":"motor","link":"/tags/motor/"},{"name":"function","slug":"function","link":"/tags/function/"},{"name":"STL","slug":"STL","link":"/tags/STL/"},{"name":"笔记","slug":"笔记","link":"/tags/笔记/"},{"name":"技巧","slug":"技巧","link":"/tags/技巧/"},{"name":"DP","slug":"DP","link":"/tags/DP/"},{"name":"DFS","slug":"DFS","link":"/tags/DFS/"},{"name":"divide
